# Installing Node.js via package manager

***Note:*** The packages on this page are maintained and supported by their respective packagers, **not** the Node.js core team. Please report any issues you encounter to the package maintainer. If it turns out your issue is a bug in Node.js itself, the maintainer will report the issue upstream.

## Android

Android support is still experimental in Node.js, so precompiled binaries are not yet provided by Node.js developers.

However, there are some third-party solutions. For example, [Termux](https://termux.com/) community provides terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android, as well as own package manager and [extensive collection](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages) of many precompiled applications. This command in Termux app will install the last available Node.js version:

```bash
pkg install nodejs
```

Currently, Termux Node.js binaries are linked against `system-icu` (depending on `libicu` package).

## Arch Linux

Node.js and npm packages are available in the Community Repository.

```bash
pacman -S nodejs npm
```

## CentOS, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Node.js is available as a module called `nodejs` in CentOS/RHEL 8 and Fedora.

```bash
dnf module install nodejs:<stream>
```

where `<stream>` corresponds to the major version of Node.js.
To see a list of available streams:

```bash
dnf module list nodejs
```

For example, to install Node.js 12:

```bash
dnf module install nodejs:12
```

For CentOS/RHEL 7 Node.js is available via [Software Collections](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/?search=NodeJS).

### Alternatives

These resources provide packages compatible with CentOS, Fedora, and RHEL.
* [Node.js snaps](#snap) maintained and supported at https://github.com/nodejs/snap
* [Node.js binary distributions](#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions) maintained and supported by [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions)

## Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distributions

[Node.js binary distributions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md) are available from NodeSource.

### Alternatives

Packages compatible with Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distributions are available via [Node.js snaps](#snap).

## FreeBSD

The most recent release of Node.js is available via the [www/node](https://www.freshports.org/www/node) port.

Install a binary package via [pkg](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?pkg):

```bash
pkg install node
```

Or compile it on your own using [ports](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?ports):

```bash
cd /usr/ports/www/node && make install
```

## Gentoo

Node.js is available in the portage tree.

```bash
emerge nodejs
```

## IBM i

LTS versions of Node.js are available from IBM, and are available via [the 'yum' package manager](https://ibm.biz/ibmi-rpms). The package name is `nodejs` followed by the major version number (for instance, `nodejs12`, `nodejs14` etc)

To install Node.js 14.x from the command line, run the following as a user with \*ALLOBJ special authority:

```bash
yum install nodejs14
```

Node.js can also be installed with the IBM i Access Client Solutions product. See [this support document](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1022619) for more details

## macOS

Download the [macOS Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/#home-downloadhead) directly from the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) web site.

_If you want to download the package with bash:_

```bash
curl "https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-${VERSION:-$(wget -qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/ | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\.pkg</a>.*|\1|p')}.pkg" > "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" && sudo installer -store -pkg "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" -target "/"
```

### Alternatives

Using **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)**:

```bash
brew install node
```

Using **[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/)**:

```bash
port install nodejs<major version>

# Example
port install nodejs7
```

Using **[pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/install-on-osx/)**:

Install the binary package:

```bash
pkgin -y install nodejs
```

Or build manually from pkgsrc:

```bash
cd pkgsrc/lang/nodejs && bmake install
```

## NetBSD

Node.js is available in the pkgsrc tree:

```bash
cd /usr/pkgsrc/lang/nodejs && make install
```

Or install a binary package (if available for your platform) using pkgin:

```bash
pkgin -y install nodejs
```

## Nodenv

`nodenv` is a lightweight node version manager, similar to `nvm`. It's simple and predictable. A rich plugin ecosystem lets you tailor it to suit your needs. Use `nodenv` to pick a Node version for your application and guarantee that your development environment matches production. 

Nodenv installation instructions are maintained [on its Github page](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#installation). Please visit that page to ensure you're following the latest version of the installation steps.

## nvm
Node Version Manager is a bash script used to manage multiple released Node.js versions. It allows
you to perform operations like install, uninstall, switch version, etc.
To install nvm, use this [install script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).

On Unix / OS X systems Node.js built from source can be installed using
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) by installing into the location that nvm expects:

```bash
env VERSION=`python tools/getnodeversion.py` make install DESTDIR=`nvm_version_path v$VERSION` PREFIX=""
```

After this you can use `nvm` to switch between released versions and versions
built from source.
For example, if the version of Node.js is v8.0.0-pre:

```bash
nvm use 8
```

Once the official release is out you will want to uninstall the version built
from source:

```bash
nvm uninstall 8
```

## OpenBSD

Node.js is available through the ports system.

```bash
/usr/ports/lang/node
```

Using [pkg_add](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/pkg_add.1) on OpenBSD:

```bash
pkg_add node
```

## openSUSE and SLE

Node.js is available in the main repositories under the following packages:

* **openSUSE Leap 42.2**: `nodejs4`
* **openSUSE Leap 42.3**: `nodejs4`, `nodejs6`
* **openSUSE Tumbleweed**: `nodejs4`, `nodejs6`, `nodejs8`
* **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 12**: `nodejs4`, `nodejs6`
  (The "Web and Scripting Module" must be [added before installing](https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/sec_add-ons_extensions.html).)

For example, to install Node.js 4.x on openSUSE Leap 42.2, run the following as root:

```bash
zypper install nodejs4
```

## SmartOS and illumos

SmartOS images come with pkgsrc pre-installed. On other illumos distributions, first install **[pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/install-on-illumos/)**, then you may install the binary package as normal:

```bash
pkgin -y install nodejs
```

Or build manually from pkgsrc:

```bash
cd pkgsrc/lang/nodejs && bmake install
```

## Snap

[Node.js snaps](https://github.com/nodejs/snap) are available as [`node`](https://snapcraft.io/node) on the Snap store.

## Solus

Solus provides Node.js in its main repository.

```bash
sudo eopkg install nodejs
```

## Void Linux

Void Linux ships Node.js stable in the main repository.

```bash
xbps-install -Sy nodejs
```

## Windows

Download the [Windows Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/#home-downloadhead) directly from the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) web site.

### Alternatives

Using **[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)**:

```bash
cinst nodejs
# or for full install with npm
cinst nodejs.install
```
